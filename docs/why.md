# Why schematic-pg?

| Concern | ORM Approach | schematic-pg Approach |
|---------|-----------|----------------------|
| Schema truth | Migrations + models + Zod + routes | One `.schema` file |
| Query visibility | Hidden behind ORM methods | Raw, parameterized SQL |
| Client ergonomics | ORM model API | Generated Prisma-like client, no ORM runtime |
| Performance | N+1, lazy loading pitfalls | Explicit `include`; batched split queries by default |
| ACL | External service or manual checks | Inline `@policy` directives |
| Validation | Separate Zod schemas | Derived from `@regex` / `@range` |
| Dependencies | Heavy (Prisma, Drizzle, etc.) | Hono + pg + Zod + hand-written parser |
